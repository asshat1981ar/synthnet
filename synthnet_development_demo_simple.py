SynthNet Self-Development Demo (Simplified)
===========================================

Simplified demonstration of SynthNet using n8n workflows to develop itself,
showcasing the concept without requiring external dependencies.

This demo shows how SynthNet can:
1. Analyze its own code using n8n workflows
2. Generate optimization suggestions
3. Execute automated testing
4. Implement continuous integration
5. Apply self-improvement through meta-learning
