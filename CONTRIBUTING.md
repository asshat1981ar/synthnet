## üìñ Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
```kotlin
/**
 * Processes semantic vector-of-thought reasoning for complex queries.
 * 
 * This function implements the core VoT algorithm combining tree search
 * with semantic embeddings to explore multiple reasoning paths.
 *
 * @param query The input query to process
 * @param context Additional context for reasoning
 * @param maxDepth Maximum depth for thought tree exploration
 * @return SemanticVoTResult containing reasoning paths and synthesis
 * 
 * @throws AIProcessingException if reasoning fails
 * @see SemanticThought
 * @since 1.0.0
 */
suspend fun processSemanticVoT(
    query: String,
    context: ReasoningContext,
    maxDepth: Int = 5
): SemanticVoTResult
```

### API Documentation
