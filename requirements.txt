# Core Python requirements for SynthNet Android MCP Ecosystem
# Most dependencies are optional with fallbacks implemented

# Core runtime (required)
asyncio-base>=3.8.0

# Optional dependencies for enhanced functionality
# networkx>=3.0  # For semantic graph operations (has fallback)
# numpy>=1.20.0  # For numerical operations (has fallback) 
# aiohttp>=3.8.0  # For HTTP client operations (has fallback)
# websockets>=10.0  # For WebSocket support (has fallback)

# Development and testing (optional)
# pytest>=6.0  # For testing
# black>=22.0  # For code formatting
# flake8>=4.0  # For code linting

# Note: SynthNet is designed to work in minimal environments
# All external dependencies have built-in fallback implementations
# This allows the system to run in resource-constrained environments
# like Android/Termux without heavy package installations
