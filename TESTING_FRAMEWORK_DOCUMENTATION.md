## Key Testing Utilities

### TestDataBuilders
Provides comprehensive test data factories for all domain models:
```kotlin
// Create test agents with various configurations
val agents = TestDataBuilders.createTestAgentList(5, projectId)

// Create complex thought trees
val thoughtTree = TestDataBuilders.createTestThoughtTree(
    projectId = projectId,
    branches = listOf(branch1, branch2)
)

// Create collaboration scenarios
val collaboration = TestDataBuilders.createTestCollaboration(
    projectId = projectId,
    consensusReached = true
)
```

### MockFactories
Provides pre-configured mock objects with realistic behavior:
```kotlin
// Create fully configured mock orchestrator
val (orchestrator, mockData, verificationHelper) = MockFactories.createFullMockOrchestrator()

// Use verification helpers
verificationHelper.verifyThoughtTreeExecuted()
verificationHelper.verifyCollaborationStarted()
verificationHelper.verifyResponseOptimized()
```

### TestCoroutineRule
Provides coroutine testing support:
```kotlin
@get:Rule
val testCoroutineRule = TestCoroutineRule()

@Test
fun testAsyncOperation() = testCoroutineRule.runTest {
    // Test coroutine-based operations
}
```

## Testing Strategies
