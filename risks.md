# Risk Assessment: SynthNet AI App

## 1. Technical Risks

*   **Complexity:** The high complexity of the AI/ML models and the multi-agent system could lead to unforeseen integration issues and bugs.
*   **Dependency:** Heavy reliance on cutting-edge libraries and frameworks. Updates or deprecations could introduce breaking changes.
*   **Performance:** The advanced AI features might lead to performance bottlenecks on mobile devices, affecting battery life and user experience.
*   **Termux Environment:** The limited native environment of Termux might pose challenges for building, testing, and debugging, especially with complex Gradle projects and the Android SDK.

## 2. Project Risks

*   **Scope Creep:** The ambitious nature of the project could lead to continuous feature additions, delaying the core deliverables.
*   **Resource Constraints:** The project requires significant computational resources for training and testing AI models, which might be limited.

## 3. Quality & Validation Risks

*   **Test Coverage:** The complexity of the AI models makes it challenging to achieve comprehensive test coverage, potentially leaving critical bugs undetected.
*   **Validation:** Validating the correctness of the AI's reasoning and decision-making processes is inherently difficult and subjective.
